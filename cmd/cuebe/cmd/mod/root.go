// RootCmd represents the base command when called without any subcommands
var RootCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "mod",
	Short: "manage CUE modules.",
	Long: `cuebe mod provides access to operations on CUE modules.
Most mod subcommands use a custom implementation of the MVS algorithm.
This is a temporary solution until [github.com/cue-lang#85](https://github.com/cue-lang/cue/issues/851) is addressed.

#### Adding requirements

Simply add a new entry to the 'require' key in cue.mod/module.cue file:

~~~cue
require: [
  { path: "github.com/tomato/ketchup", version: "v1.0.3" },
]
~~~

#### Private modules

When dealing with private modules, cuebe offers two solutions:
- leveraging credentials within your ~/.netrc file
- exporting **HOST_ADDRESS_TOKEN** and **HOST_ADDRESS_USER** environment variable (e.g. **GITHUB_COM_TOKEN** for github.com)
`,
}

func init() {
	RootCmd.AddCommand(
		newGenCmd(),
		newVendorCmd(),
	)
}
